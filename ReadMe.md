# Welcome to the CSUG Summer Challenge Series 1: CSS Challenge :fire:

### The CSUG e-board has created a website for our organization and we want YOUR help to design it with your ideas and creativity :sunglasses: :tada:

1. How to participate:
- [ ] Register on our google form: [registration form](https://forms.gle/ECbZNKfGBFrsf9xTA)
- [ ] Fork this repository (don't work directly on this repo since you won't have the permission to push your code)
- [ ] Clone the repository to your local machine
- [ ] Begin making changes to the CSS design of the website
- [ ] When you're ready, submit by filling out the submission form: [submission form](https://forms.gle/CDhTKesDaz28gKNy7)

2. How to run the website:
- When you've already cloned the repo to your local computer, open the .html files by **double click** on them. It should run on your web browser. 
- Make changes to the files on your favorite text editor, then **reload** the webpage. It will show your recent changes.

3. Contents of the repo:

- ./Pictures/ [link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/tree/master/Pictures): This folder includes pictures that you can use including the new logo of our club. ([link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/blob/master/Pictures/pngFormat.png))
    - We have pictures of the e-board members and a few other photos that can be used for design purpose.  

- ./Plain Template/ [link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/tree/master/Plain%20Template): This is the folder which has the MAIN skeleton HTML code of two web pages, our homepage and the internship page.
     Most of the link tags have been replaced with "#" for now. Your main challenge is to re-design this part. 

- ./Designed Template/ [link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/tree/master/DesignedTemplate): This folder contains example code for reference. The e-board has put this together for reference. 
In case you want a general idea for a layout, then feel free to use this. You are also free to modify this for your submission! (Even a changed color counts!)
