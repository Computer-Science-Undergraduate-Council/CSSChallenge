# Welcome to the CSUG Summer Challenge Series 1: CSS Challenge :fire:

### The CSUG e-board has created a website for our organization and we want YOUR help to design it with your ideas and creativity :sunglasses: :tada:

### This event will take place at July 5th, 10 AM - July 6th, 10PM Eastern Standard Time.

- [ ] Clone the repository to your local machine
- [ ] Begin making changes to the CSS design of the website

#### 2. How to run the web pages:
- When you've already cloned the repo to your local computer, open the ***.html*** files by **double click** on them. It should run on your web browser. 
- Make changes to the files on your favorite text editor, then **reload** the webpage. It will show your recent changes.

#### 3. Contents of the repo:

- ./Pictures/ ([link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/tree/master/Pictures)): This folder includes pictures that you can use including the new logo of our club. We have pictures of the e-board members and a few other photos that can be used for design purpose.  

    - Logo: ([link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/blob/master/Pictures/pngFormat.png))
    - Eboard members photos: ([link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/tree/master/Pictures/E-board))
    - Internship Page: ([link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/tree/master/Pictures/Internship))
    - Additional Images: ([link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/tree/master/Pictures/AdditionalImages))
    
- ./Plain Template/ ([link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/tree/master/Plain%20Template)): This is the folder which has the MAIN skeleton HTML code of two web pages, our homepage and the internship page.
    - Homepage: [index.html](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/blob/master/Plain%20Template/index.html)
    - Internship page: [internshipPage.html](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/blob/master/Plain%20Template/internshipPage.html)
    
     Most of the link tags have been replaced with "#" for now. Your main challenge is to re-design this part. 

- ./Designed Template/ ([link](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/tree/master/DesignedTemplate)): This folder includes the same content as the plain template above, but contains example code for reference. The e-board has put this together for reference. 
    - Homepage: [index.html](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/blob/master/DesignedTemplate/index.html)
    - Internship page: [internshipPage.html](https://github.com/Computer-Science-Undergraduate-Council/CSSChallenge/blob/master/DesignedTemplate/internshipPage.html)
    
    In case you want a general idea for a layout, then feel free to use this. You are also free to modify this for your submission! (Even a changed color counts!)
