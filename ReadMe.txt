Welcome to the CSUG Summer Challenge Series 1: CSS Challenge

The CSUG e-board has created a website and we want your help to design it with your ideas and creativity.

Please fork this repository and then clone it to work with it. 
Submission will be via a google form that will be linked here soon and will be emailed as well. 


The following will be the contents of the repo - 

Pictures: This folder will have pictures that you can use including the new logo of our club. 
    We have pictures of the e-board members and a few other photos that can be used for design purpose.  

Plain Template: This is the folder which has the MAIN skeleton HTML code of two web pages, our homepage and the internship page.
     Most of the link tags have been replaced with "#" for now. Your main challenge is to re-design this part. 

Designed Template: This folder contains example code for reference. The e-board has put this together for reference. 
In case you want a general idea for a layout, then feel free to use this. You are also free to modify this for your submission! (Even a changed color counts!)
